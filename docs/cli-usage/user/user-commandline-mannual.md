## 2 Start-node related commands

### 2.1 init

Introduction

Used to create a wallet in the specified path. If the wallet information already exists in this path, the existing wallet will be used directly without recreating the wallet.
Assign the MEFS_PATH environment virable to specify a path for this node.

Usage

```shell
mefs-user init -h
```

Options

   --keyfile value, --kf value   absolute path of keyfile
   --kpw value      password to decrypt keyfile
   --help, -h       show help (default: false)
```

Example

```shell

```

The example sets the root directory of the node to: ~/.memo-user

   --object value, --on value              objectName
   --etag value, --cid value, --md5 value  etag (cid or md5)
   --start value                           start position (default: 0)
   --length value                          read length (default: -1)
   --path value                            stored path of file

   --help, -h                              show help (default: false)
```

Note

--etag option here can be substituted by cid or md5, all of them has the same meaning.
If bucket password is used(aes1 is set when putObject), the value of --objectID is ommited.

--decrypt option is the bucket/object password set when putObject.

Example 1

Download an object without etag.

```shell
mefs-user lfs getObject --bn=test --on=1  --path=./index.html
```

Example 2

Download an object with etag and password.

./mefs-user lfs getObject --md5 f1c9645dbc14efddc7d8a322685f26eb --userID 36 --bucketID 0 --objectID 1 --decrypt  09a74f0cd7ff9d098f1753a83ed523d0c16b79ca2ce9ca5b5459ffada7e2376c --path aa

## 5 Other commands

### 5.1 auth

Introduction

Query the value of the token file of the node. The token file is located in the root directory of the node. Ordinary users do not need to pay attention to this value.

### 5.2 log command

Introduction

This command is used to set the log level. Different levels display log information of different alarm levels. The default is info level, which only displays normal status information. Ordinary users should use info log level. The debug/warn/error level is used by developers to view detailed error logs. This level will generate a large number of logs and cannot be in debug mode for a long time, otherwise it will take up a lot of disk space. It is not recommended for ordinary users to use.

Subcommands 

#### 5.2.1 setLevel

Usage

```shell
mefs-user log setLevel -h

NAME:
   mefs-user log setLevel - Set log level

USAGE:
   mefs-user log setLevel [command options] [level (debug/info/warn/error)]
```

Example

```shell
mefs-user log setLevel debug
