## 2 Start-node related commands

### 2.1 init

Introduction

Used to create a wallet in the specified path. If the wallet information already exists in this path, the existing wallet will be used directly without recreating the wallet.
Assign the MEFS_PATH environment virable to specify a path for this node.

Usage

```shell
mefs-provider init -h
```

Options

```shell

   --keyfile value, --kf value   absolute path of keyfile
   --kpw value      password to decrypt keyfile
   --help, -h       show help (default: false)
```

Example

```shell
